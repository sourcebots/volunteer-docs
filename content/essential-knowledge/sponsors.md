title: Who we're sponsored by
---

When carrying running the competition and any public-facing parts of our organisation, it is important to bear in mind and give credit to the companies/organisations that support us; in other words putting their logo on things and thanking them where thanks are due.

## Companies that sponsor us are as follows:

### [University of Southampton][uos-website]

We are sponsored by the University of Southampton electronics and Computer Science Department, so that we can be a source of recruitment for potential STEM students, currently in their A-level/sixth-form years and looking at universities for electronics or computer science.

### [Farnell element14][farnell-website]

Farnell supports us by providing components for the kits.
We write blog posts for their website for other societies or organisations trying to do similar things(i.e. running robotics competitions, building competition-running software).

## For the Smallpeice Summer School, we are additionally sponsored by:

### [Smallpeice Trust][smallpeice-website]

Smallpeice Trust is an independent charity which works with universities and other institutes to provide STEM programmes to children in schools (typically ages 12-18) and allow them to get involved with and excited about a career in STEM subjects.
They support the Summer School by getting the kids involved in the first place and paying for some aspects of the competition proceedings (e.g. kits, volunteers if there is budget for it).
