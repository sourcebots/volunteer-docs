# A guide on how to contribute code

Welcome! If you're new to GitHub and open source, it can seem quite difficult to get started.
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to contribute code to the SourceBots project!

## How to set up GitHub
Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/join

It's useful to stay logged in, so it's as easy as possible to keep up to date and make contributions

## How to choose something to work on
Have a look at [TODO: find page]

## Encouragement to make small changes
We encourage you to make any changes, however small. e.g. if you spot a spelling error somewhere, why not fix it and make a pull request? This is a good way to familiarise yourself with the process, and is a good stepping stone towards larger contributions.

## How to make a small change (e.g. to website / docs) using GitHub online editor: *all* the steps. Make a commit to a new branch, submit a PR. In detail, for people who have never used git.
TODO.

## How to set up git on your local machine
TODO: join this with the later documentation. + perhaps add an external guide

## Using git by CLI / GitHub desktop app (e.g. adding some code)
## Conventions for PRs, commits, comments

More advanced:
* Code review (?)
* Setting up dev environment
