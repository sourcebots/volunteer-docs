# A guide on how to contribute code

Welcome! If you're new to GitHub and open source, it can seem quite difficult to get started.
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to contribute code to the SourceBots project!

## How to set up GitHub
[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), or log in if you already have an account.

It's useful to stay logged in, so it's as easy as possible to keep up to date and make contributions.

## How to choose something to work on
Have a look at [TODO: find page]

## Encouragement to make small changes
We encourage you to make any changes, however small. e.g. if you spot a spelling error somewhere, why not fix it and make a pull request? This is a good way to familiarise yourself with the process, and is a good stepping stone towards larger contributions.

## How to make a small change (e.g. to website / docs) using GitHub online editor: *all* the steps. Make a commit to a new branch, submit a PR. In detail, for people who have never used git.
TODO.
* becoming a member of SourceBots organisation
* setting up a new branch on the SourceBots repo (not creating a fork)

## How to set up git on your local machine
To make more advanced changes, it may be necessary to install and set up git on your local machine.
To install git, see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.

TODO:
* adding ssh keys, where relevant
* adding GitHub auth tokens, where relevant
* ? does the GitHub desktop app, or GitKraken, or other IDEs guide you through this process well? Subsections maybe

## Using git by CLI / GitHub desktop app (e.g. adding some code)
TODO:
* setting up a new branch on the SourceBots repo (not creating a fork)
* how to make a commit
* how to push to a branch


## Conventions for PRs, commits, comments

More advanced:
* Code review (?)
* Setting up dev environment
