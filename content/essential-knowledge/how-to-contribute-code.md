# A guide on how to contribute code

Welcome! If you're new to GitHub and open source, it can seem quite difficult to get started.
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to contribute code to the SourceBots project!

## How to set up GitHub
[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), or log in if you already have an account.

It's useful to stay logged in, so it's as easy as possible to keep up to date and make contributions.

## How to choose something to work on
Have a look at [TODO: find page]

## Encouragement to make small changes
We encourage you to make any changes, however small. e.g. if you spot a spelling error somewhere, why not fix it and make a pull request? This is a good way to familiarise yourself with the process, and is a good stepping stone towards larger contributions.

## How to make a small change (e.g. to website / docs) using GitHub online editor: 

Suppose you have a file you'd like to change. Then,

TODO: *all* the steps. Make a commit to a new branch, submit a PR. In detail, for people who have never used git.

* becoming a member of SourceBots organisation
* setting up a new branch on the SourceBots repo (not creating a fork)
- or, depending on our contribution system, creating a fork.
* making an edit (with the pencil icon) -> set up a new branch, if you haven't already.
Naming the branch. 
You can't push to master.
This might create a fork automatically for you if you're not a member of the [SourceBots organisation](https://github.com/sourcebots).
* committing the changes (with meaningful commit message + description)
* adding more changes to your branch (flat structure: don't create a sub-branch (terminology?) and do a PR from sub-branch -> your new branch?)
* creating a pull request (TODO: when?)
* waiting for someone to review your code (and/or asking for feedback, perhaps on the slack)
* committing more changes, completing the review process

TODO: put these TODOs in more appropriate places other than in the document itself?

TODO: link to a good guide (with more detail) about this. But it's good to have our own version for making minimal commits and PRs for *our* specific workflow. It's also a useful way for people like myself to learn by writing.

TODO: include *tip* boxes? For tangential but useful information/explanation about the general principles behind e.g. commits, forks, branches, and more complete guides/exceptions about when to do different things. (Or, in another style? By an example of a project with good documentation)

## How to set up git on your local machine
To make more advanced changes, it may be necessary to install and set up git on your local machine.
To install git, see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.

TODO:

* adding ssh keys, where relevant
* adding GitHub auth tokens, where relevant
* ? does the GitHub desktop app, or GitKraken, or other IDEs guide you through this process well? Subsections maybe

## Using git by CLI / GitHub desktop app (e.g. adding some code)
TODO:

* setting up a new branch on the SourceBots repo (not creating a fork)
* how to make a commit
* how to push to a branch


## Conventions for PRs, commits, comments

More advanced:

* Code review (?)
* Setting up dev environment
