## Mailing list

## Trello

Trello is mainly used for strategic planning.
Trello tasks will refer to things such as milestones on Github issues or other similar objectives, components of features, issues and bugs should be in the components issue tracker rather than Trello.
Some Trello boards however will be used for tracking small tasks on things that donâ€™t have a separate issue tracker.

Trello can be accessed at https://trello.com/smallpeice2016


## Github

Github is the main storage location for our version controlled code.
It also provides issue tracking for the included repositories.

The google docs folder is used to store information that cannot or should not be stored publicly.
