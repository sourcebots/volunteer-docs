title: Booking a Tech Day
---

During a competition, we host multiple events throughout the year called tech days where the competitors have the opportunity to come to the university and work on their robots whilst also receiving mentoring from us!

This guide will describe the typical rooms that we use for the tech days and the process you need to take in order to secure them!

As these rooms are part of the University of Southampton, it is required that you are a current student / staff member in order to book them.
