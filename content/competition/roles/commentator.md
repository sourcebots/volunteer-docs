**Responsible for commentating matches and building a large amount of excitement amongst those near the arenas.**

As a commentator you will be stationed near to the arena and able to walk freely around it. You will be given access to a PA system via a microphone for which to speak through to address the audience. It's important that you do not make announcements to volunteers through this.
