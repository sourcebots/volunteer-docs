This section contains information on the various roles that we assign to volunteers during the competition.

Some roles are scheduled on a rota, generally these are the more important roles that are required for the competition to function. More detailed information on all the roles can be found in the [Student Robotics Event Coordination Documentation ](https://bitbucket.org/rspanton/sr-event-coord/wiki/Home).
