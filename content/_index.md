We meet weekly at the University of Southampton on Monday evenings at 6pm. Our usual location is in Building 53 (Mountbatten), Room 4025. However, this is subject to change if the room is in use for other activities. Any room changes will be announced prior to the meeting.

We also hold a Google Hangout call at the same time as this meeting. The link to the Hangout can be found in the agenda for the meeting.
